# Description of Project
The purpose of this project is to create a reactive page which adjusts to fit all its internal elements on multiple screens. 
In addition, it provides potential employers with a way to sample my work and find out more infomation about me. 

## List of Reactive Elements
[CSS]
* Created variables for recurring elements in stylesheet to prevent redundancy
* `<nav>` elements are linked to related content; they also turn red when hovered over
* `<main>` element contained within a flex box to allow responsive content
* `<section>` elements within `<main>` tag have flex styling as well to allow them to grow/shrink as needed
* Used class ID "work" to apply styling to both headings for "About Me" and "My Work" sections
* Created a separate class for the first `<section>` element within the flexbox to allow it to be bigger than the other elements
* Nested `<a>` links within `<div>` elements in the `<main>` flex box to allow users to go to linked content
* Created a hover element for the `<div>` element for accessibility
* Unable to add alt tags for images other than selfie because images in flexbox are acting as a background element
* Created flex box for `<footer>` element to allow it to flex with the page and also stay at the bottom of the page
