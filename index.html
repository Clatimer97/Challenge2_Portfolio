      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Callan Latimer, and I am new to the tech world. 
          I have been working as a nurse for two and a half years.
          My primary speciality is Orthopedic/Urology surgical recovery.
          I currently work at Northside Atlanta, but I did travel nursing 
          for six months. I am pursuing my interest in technology while 
          working full time as a Registered Nurse. I hope to one day break
          into the field of video game development. I look forward to learning
          the necessary skills through this incredible opportunity.
